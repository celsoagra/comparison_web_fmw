  "version": "1.4.0",
  "description": "Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can \"just run\". We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.",
  "url": "http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/",
  "pros": "Create stand-alone Spring applications\nEmbed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)\nProvide opinionated 'starter' POMs to simplify your Maven configuration\nAutomatically configure Spring whenever possible\nProvide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration\nAbsolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration",
  "cons": ""
